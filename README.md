# Hello, I'm Siddharth! 👋

- 🏫 I'm a CSE student at KIIT Bhubaneshwar, with a passion for open-source :octocat: and a love for driving cars. 🚗 
- 🌱 I'm an aspiring software engineer, and I'm proficient in C/C++, Python, Bash, HTML, and CSS. 
- 👀 I'm also interested in web development, and have created a cool [custom CSS theme for Vivaldi](https://themes.vivaldi.net/themes/Qbnlj4pmJ2m) .

## Open-source Contributions 🌐

- [auto-cpufreq](https://github.com/AdnanHodzic/auto-cpufreq): I found and documented a solution to a problem that Arch users were having with the software, the project has received over 3.5K stars ⭐ and has 45+ active contributors.

## Projects :octocat:

- [starship-update-script](https://github.com/siddharthkumarjha/starship-update-script): An update wrapper for the Starship cross-shell prompt, which checks both the remote and local version to decide if updating is necessary. Currently under development.
- [Funngro landing page](https://siddharthkumarjha.github.io/Funngro): I designed an interactive landing page for the startup funngro as a part of my evaluation project. The landing page attempts to curb the current bugs that their website has.
