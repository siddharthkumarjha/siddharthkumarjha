# Hello, I'm Siddharth! 👋

- 🏫 I'm a CSE student at KIIT Bhubaneshwar, with a passion for open-source :octocat: and a love for driving cars. 🚗 
- 🌱 I'm an aspiring software engineer, and I'm proficient in C/C++, Python, Bash, HTML, and CSS. 
- 👀 I'm also interested in web development, and have created a cool [custom CSS theme for Vivaldi](https://themes.vivaldi.net/themes/Qbnlj4pmJ2m) .
- What I love? Ofc it's embedded coding. I love C and C++. Lately I have been learning Rust and assembly as well.

## Open-source Contributions 🌐

- [auto-cpufreq](https://github.com/AdnanHodzic/auto-cpufreq/releases/tag/v1.9.8): I found and documented a solution to a problem that Arch users were having with the software, the project has received over 3.5K stars ⭐ and has 45+ active contributors.
- [Garuda linux wiki](https://gitlab.com/garuda-linux/website/wiki/-/merge_requests/2): I helped garuda team with documenting their `garuda-update` command.

## Projects :octocat:

- [Funngro landing page](https://siddharthkumarjha.github.io/Funngro): I designed an interactive landing page for the startup funngro as a part of my evaluation project. The landing page attempts to curb the current bugs that their website has.
- [Aurionpro helpdesk webapp](https://github.com/siddharthkumarjha/Aurionpro-helpdesk-webapp): I have built a fullstack webapp using react for frontend and nodejs for backend integration with mysql. It has role based login and is meant to handle ticket generation, updation, linking, and emailing to respective parties. It currently handles sending emails via a sandboxed mailtrap's smtp server which can be easily replaced with a real smtp. It has three types of roles at the moment: user, employee and manager. 
  * The project is currently being tested by aurionpro before being deployed on their production server.

## What I am currently working on? 
- [Arduino baremetal](https://github.com/siddharthkumarjha/arduino-baremetal): I have always been facinated with baremetal low level code so I am working on writing that. Simple examples nothing crazy yet. But eventually I wish to participate in projects like tock and linux.
