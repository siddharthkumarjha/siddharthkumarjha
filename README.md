# Hello, I'm Siddharth! 👋

- 🏫 I'm a CSE student at KIIT Bhubaneshwar, with a passion for open-source :octocat: and a love for driving cars. :car: 
- 🌱 I'm an aspiring software engineer, and I'm proficient in C/C++, Python, Bash, HTML, and CSS. 
- 👀 I'm also interested in web development, and have created a cool [custom CSS theme for Vivaldi](https://themes.vivaldi.net/themes/Qbnlj4pmJ2m) .

## Projects :octocat:
